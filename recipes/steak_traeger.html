    <h2>A ridiculously flavorful steak smoked to perfection with your Traeger Ranger!</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Garlic Butter: 1/2 Cup</li>
        <li>Finely Chopped Shallots: 2 Tablespoons</li>
        <li>Minced Garlic: 1 Tablespoon</li>
        <li>Steak! Preferably Rib-Eye</li>
        <li>Kosher Salt 1/4 Teaspoon</li>
        <li>Freshly Ground Black Pepper: 1/4 Teaspoon</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the garlic butter: Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the shallot and sauté until tender and lightly browned, 3-4 minutes. Add the garlic and continue to sauté for another minute, until fragrant. Remove the pot from the heat and let cool for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer the shallot mixture to a medium bowl with the remaining 1/2 cup butter and mix until well combined.</li>
        <li>Transfer the garlic butter to a sheet of plastic wrap. Fold the plastic wrap over the butter and twist one end to close. Shape the butter into a log, then twist the other end to seal tightly. Refrigerate until ready to use, up to 3 days.</li>
        <li>Make the steak: When ready to cook, set the Traeger temperature to 225 °F and preheat with the lid closed for 15 minutes. For optimal flavor, use Super Smoke, if available.</li>
        <li>Season the steaks on both sides with salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Insert the probe into the center of a steak. Place the steaks directly on the grill grates. Close the lid and smoke until the internal temperature reaches 115 °F, 45-60 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the steaks cook, remove the garlic butter from the refrigerator and let come to room temperature.</li>
        <li>Remove the steaks from the grill. Increase the Traeger temperature to 450 °F (or 500°F, if available) and preheat with the lid closed for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Slice the garlic butter into 1/4-inch-thick rounds.</li>
        <li>Re-insert the probe and return the steaks to the grill. Close the lid and sear until the internal temperature reaches 125 °F for medium-rare, about 5 minutes per side, or your desired temperature.</li>
        <li>Remove the steaks from the grill and immediately top each with a round of garlic butter. Let the steaks rest for 10 minutes (the internal temperature will continue to rise to 130 °F).</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
