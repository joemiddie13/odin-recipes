Odin Project: Recipes

Hey there! Thanks for stopping by to check out a great recipe and my first project via The Odin Project.

This is part of the beginning Foundations section of The Odin Project and will start with the basics of HTML as of January 4, 2022.

I have spent the past month on Codecademy's learning path, Full Stack Engineer. I was about to wrap up CSS and move onto the basics of Javascript when I got a bit frustrated with the feeling of having my "hand held too much". I hope to continue down both paths and will use the two platforms to supplement each other.

Here: I am trying to learn the difference between committing the files via the VS Code Terminal, MacOS Terminal, and the simple VS Code Commit feature.
